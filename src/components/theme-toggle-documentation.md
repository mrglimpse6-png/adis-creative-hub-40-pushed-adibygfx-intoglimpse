## Usage

function Navigation() {
  return (
    <nav>
      {/* Other navigation items */}
      <EnhancedThemeToggle />
    </nav>
  )
}
```

  return (
    <div className="toolbar">
      <CompactThemeToggle />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Component Variants

### 1. EnhancedThemeToggle (Default)
- Full-featured with all animations
- 48px touch target

- Best for main navigation

### 2. CompactThemeToggle

## Customization

### Color Schemes
The component uses CSS custom properties that can be overridden:

```css
.theme-toggle-custom {
  --light-bg: linear-gradient(135deg, #fef3c7, #fed7aa, #fde68a);
  --light-text: #d97706;
  --dark-bg: linear-gradient(135deg, #1e293b, #1e40af, #3730a3);
  --dark-text: #93c5fd;
}
```

### Animation Timing
Adjust animation speeds by modifying duration classes:

```tsx
// Faster animations
className="transition-all duration-300"

// Slower animations  
className="transition-all duration-700"
```

### Size Variations
```tsx
// Large version
className="h-16 w-16 rounded-3xl"

// Small version
className="h-8 w-8 rounded-lg"
```

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
Uses the `useTheme` hook from the theme provider:
```tsx
const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme()
```

### Animation Triggers
- **Hover**: Scale and shadow effects
- **Click**: Ripple effect with temporary state
- **Theme Change**: Icon morphing with rotation/scaling

### Performance Considerations
- Uses CSS transforms for smooth animations
- Minimal re-renders with React state
- Hardware acceleration for smooth performance
- Respects reduced motion preferences

## Browser Support
- **Modern Browsers**: Full feature support
- **Legacy Browsers**: Graceful degradation
- **Mobile**: Touch-optimized interactions
- **Screen Readers**: Full accessibility support
